# Welcome to Contributing guide for RTFD project

## Introduction

I really appreciate your time even to read this page and I will be very happy if you help me with my project.

## Contributing

The easiest way to help develop this project is to solve <a href='https://github.com/greentech72/Real-Time-Face-Detection/issues'>issues</a> that exist.

Of course if you spot some problems/bugs/you think you can do better you are welcome to open your own issue and solve it. After that you can create <a href='https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests'>pull request</a>, wait and hope that I am not dead yet.
